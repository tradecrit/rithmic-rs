# Rust Rithmic R | Protocol API client

Unofficial rust client for connecting to Rithmic's R | Protocol API.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/rithmic-rs/latest/rithmic_rs/) | [Rithmic APIs](https://www.rithmic.com/apis)


Not all functionality has been implemented, but this is currently being used to trade live capital through Rithmic.

Only `order_plant`, `ticker_plant`, `pnl_plant`, `history_plant` are provided. Each plant uses the actor pattern so you'll want to start a plant, and communicate / call commands with it using it's handle. The crate is setup to be used with tokio channels.

## Installation

You can install it from crates.io

```
$ cargo add rithmic-rs
```

Or manually add it to your `Cargo.toml` file.


```
[dependencies]
rithmic-rs = "0.3.4"
```

## Usage

Store your credentials in a `.env` file.

```sh
# .env
RITHMIC_TEST_USER=<USER_NAME>
RITHMIC_TEST_PW=<PASSWORD>

RITHMIC_DEMO_USER=<USER_NAME>
RITHMIC_DEMO_PW=<PASSWORD>

RITHMIC_LIVE_USER=<USER_NAME>
RITHMIC_LIVE_PW=<PASSWORD>
```

Rithmic supports three types of account environments, `RithmicConnectionSystem::Demo` is used for paper trading, `RithmicConnectionSystem::Live` will connect to your funded account, and `RithmicConnectionSystem::Test` connects to the test environment before your app is approved.

To use this crate, pass in your account information to one of the plants. Doing so will spawn an actor in a new thread that listens to commands that you send via a handle. Some plants like the ticker plant will also include a broadcast channel that you can listen to for wire level updates.

```rust
pub async fn stream_live_ticks(
    &self,
    env: &RithmicConnectionSystem,
    account_info: &AccountInfo
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    event!(Level::INFO, "market-data streaming ticks");

    let ticker_plant = RithmicTickerPlant::new(env, account_info).await;
    let ticker_plant_handle = ticker_plant.get_handle();

    let mut min_backoff_wait = 1;

    while let Err(err) = ticker_plant_handle.login().await {
        event!(Level::ERROR, "market-data: login failed: {}", err);

        sleep(Duration::from_secs(min_backoff_wait)).await;

        min_backoff_wait *= 2;

        if min_backoff_wait > 60 {
            event!(Level::ERROR, "market-data: login exceeded max backoff");

            panic!("market-data: login exceeded max backoff")
        }
    }

    handle.subscribe("ESM5", "CME").await?;

    loop {
        let message = ticker_plant_handle.subscription_receiver.recv().await;

        match message {
            Ok(update) => {
                match update.message {
                    RithmicMessage::LastTrade(u) => {
                        let tick = Tick {
                            dir: u.aggressor.unwrap(),
                            price: u.trade_price.unwrap(),
                            vol: u.trade_size.unwrap(),
                            utime: u.ssboe.unwrap() as i64 * 1_000_000 + u.usecs.unwrap() as i64
                        };

                        if let Some(s) = self.stream_map.get(&u.symbol.unwrap()) {
                            if let Err(e) = s.send(tick) {
                                event!(Level::ERROR, "market-data: failed to send tick: {}", e);
                            };
                        }
                    }
                    _ => {}
                }
            }
            Err(RecvError::Lagged(count)) => {
                event!(Level::WARN, "{} messages lagged", count);
            }
            Err(err) => {
                event!(Level::ERROR, "received error {:?}", err);

                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
